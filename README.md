# python-quadratic-solver
This solves equations using the quadratic formula. It's probably super unoptimized, but I don't care since it does its job.

When you run it, it will ask for A, B, and C.
Input A, B, and C from your Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 equation.

It will print the Discriminant and the solution(s) to the equation in simplest form.

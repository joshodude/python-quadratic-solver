# python-quadratic-solver
This solves equations using the quadratic formula. It's probably super unoptimized, but I don't care since it does its job.

When you run it, it will ask for A, B, and C.
Input A, B, and C from your Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 equation.

It will print the discriminant and the solution(s) to the equation.



Example:

A = 8
B = 0
C = -22

Discriminant:  704

(0 ± 8√11) / (16)
